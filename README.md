README FILE FOR ITS PROJECT FOR GROUP 3
The idea of this project is to make an automatized charging station for electric vehicle. This project is specially designated for women or elderly people that don't have the required strenght to plug in the heavy cable inside the port.

Inside this repository can be found all the python scripts that are used to build the project and the virtual environment with all the packages needed to make the everything work.
At 29/05/2024 we have 3 files, main.py, motori.py and ultrasuoni.py (those names should be changed from italian to english to maintain a certain standard).

ultrasuoni.py has a "get_distance()" function that needs two parameters, trigger and echo, wich are pins used by the ultrsound sensor and needed to calculate the distance.

TODO:
motore.py

main.py is the main body of the project, it contains calls to the many functions used by the project.
